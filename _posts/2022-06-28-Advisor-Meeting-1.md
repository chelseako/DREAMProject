**Plan:** Reviewed the difference between a survey paper and original research and decided to try to conduct original research with a final goal of a publication.  

**Timeline:** Agreed to complete about half of the DREAM Program during the summer quarter and the other half during the fall quarter.  

**Research Topic:** 
* Can we build a model that classifies stress/non-stress states using the least amount of input while maintaining accuracy?  
* Hooking a patient up to an EKG or device that has many sensors may be more accurate is invasive and may cause additional stress/anxiety or might affect the person's behavior.  
* Identify least invasive method for using sensors to measure stress/anxiety/depression.

**Action Items**
1. Research different sensors and how they are placed on the patient.
2. Look up body sensor datasets (wireless body sensor networks, body sensor networks, body area networks, e-health)
3. Research stress/anxiety/depression scales and identify the clearest/most established scale in the literature.

**Scales Notes:**
* Use a term that is clearly defined in the literature (e.g., is there a stress scale from 0 to 100 with cutoff values for high, moderate, low).
* Need to identify “gold standard” scale that can be used as ground truth to establish stress/depression/anxiety level and identify benchmark and less invasive sensor accuracy levels.
* Look at datasets that already have reported levels of stress. How do they rate whether patient is stressed or not stressed?
* Apply method A, look up score, and this is your benchmark. Compare difference using other methods. E.g., if your stress level is 75, compare between self-assessment, sensor, and MRI which is closest.

**Sensors Notes:**
* Try to find published research on sensors; may be difficult for companies that built sensor products (e.g., Affectiva has a brand of smart watches; televagal device by Dr. Porges).
* Look up affective computing (Picard) - had a spinoff company of Affectiva.

**Datasets Notes**
* Many datasets are open and accessible. All publicly funded research datasets in the US and Canada are publicly available.
