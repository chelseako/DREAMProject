**Notes**  

I met with my Research Mentor, Dr. Gabe Fierro, and my three other group members. We discussed our backgrounds and research projects, and Dr. Fierro gave feedback from his experiences related to our projects. Dr. Fierro also shared his journey from obtaining his undergraduate and graduate degrees to becoming an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines.
