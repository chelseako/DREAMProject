**I reviewed survey and original research papers, which discussed:**
* Physiological indicators that are measured to detect stress, the devices used to measure them, and how the data are cleaned and processed to produce the outcome measures.
* Behavioral indicators used to detect stress, such as audio/video speech and facial expression recordings, cell phone usage, or keystroke behavior.
* Self-report questionnaires used to measure stress, such as the Perceived Stress Scale.
* Research environments and methodology used to detect stress, including laboratory, semi-restricted, and daily life.
* Tasks used in the laboratory or in semi-restricted environments to induce stress.
* Machine learning techniques used to analyze data and predict stress/non-stress states.
