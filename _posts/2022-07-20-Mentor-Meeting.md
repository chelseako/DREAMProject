# 1:1 Mentor Meeting July 20, 2022

**Notes**

I had my 1:1 meeting with Dr. Fierro today. We discussed different career paths that become available with obtaining a Ph.D. in Computing as well as some of my questions regarding these career paths. Dr. Fierro provided honest responses to my questions from his and his colleagues' experiences. One of my main takeaways was that it is very rewarding to work as an advisor and professor, helping the next generation to learn and grow, and that conducting research is very intellectually stimulating.
