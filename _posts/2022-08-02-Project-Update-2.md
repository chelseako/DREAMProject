# Project Update

## Date: August 2, 2022

**I am continuing to review the literature on:**
* Scales used to determine the "ground truth" of stress, anxiety, and/or depression.
* Physiological sensors used to detect stress.
* Methodology used to induce stress and collect, process, and analyze data.
* Available datasets that we may be able to use to answer our research questions.
