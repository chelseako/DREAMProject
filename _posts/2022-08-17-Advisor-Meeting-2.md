**Notes:**

* I prepared and presented a deck on the literature I reviewed thus far on stress detection sensors, scales, and datasets.
* Dr. Oteafy provided guidance on additional topics to explore to further the review on scales and specific stress detection devices that are currently available.
* Discussed whether project would be useful to psychologists/therapists/counselors.
* Discussed need for IRB approval and possibility of recruiting undergraduate students to collect data.

**Action Items:**
1. Determine top 1-2 scales for stress/anxiety
2. Determine top 1-2 sensor devices
3. Contact psychologists/therapists/counselors to determine if project would be useful
