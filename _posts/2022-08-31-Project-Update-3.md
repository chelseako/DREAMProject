**Notes:**

I received some feedback from my colleagues, who said that evaluating effectiveness would be helpful in their work to justify the cost of therapy, should their insurance not cover it. Another colleague stated the patients would likely be more willing to participate if the sensor/wristband was provided to them for free.

I remembered from my prior training that "biofeedback" was an intervention used to reduce anxiety and conducted a literature review on this topic. This review opened a plethora of research related to sensors used with the biofeedback intervention as well as to measure heart rate variability in counseling. I found a really great survey paper that delineates how the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems work together to manage an individual's stress response as well as the theory behind why humans evolved these systems and how improving heart rate variability improves an individual's ability to manage emotions, improve therapeutic outcomes, and reduce chronic health problems.
