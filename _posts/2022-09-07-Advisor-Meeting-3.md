# Advisor Meeting

## Date: September 7, 2022

**Overview:**

* I prepared and presented a deck on the literature I reviewed since our last meeting, including an overview of the survey paper on the social brain and heart rate variability and their implications for psychotherapy. 
* I also reviewed the table I created on the different attributes for both sensors and scales.
* We discussed the plan moving forward for the fall quarter and decided to do a survey paper on the literature I reviewed thus far and potentially discuss continuing the research project after the fall 2022 term.
* We scheduled weekly meeting appointments for the remainder of the fall 2022 term.

**Action Items:**
1. Look deeper at how the therapeutic index (objective sensor measure of the therapeutic alliance) was calculated.
2. Add any missing information and scales used to evaluate psychotherapeutic outcome to literature review table.
