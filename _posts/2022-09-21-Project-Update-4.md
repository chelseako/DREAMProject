# Project Update

## Date: September 21, 2022

**I took a closer look at:** 
* How the therapeutic index is calculated
* How physiological data is cleaned and processed
* Scales used to evaluate therapy effectiveness/outcomes

I also started drafting an introduction and justification for evaluating the effectiveness of counseling using physiological data, including the theory behind how heart rate variability relates to mental health and therapeutic outcomes. I am unsure what/how much information is needed and am planning to check in with my advisor at our next meeting.
