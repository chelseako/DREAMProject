**Overview:**  

* We reviewed my Github DREAM Project website and discussed modifications.
* We revisited our goals, plan, and timeline for the DREAM Project.
    * Goal & Timeline: Submit two papers for publication by the end of the quarter.
        * Survey paper on the least invasive and most reliable sensors that provide all the data needed.
        * Framework paper that identifies machine learning techniques that can be used to determine the best sensors.
    * Plan: This week examine available datasets; next week during our meeting complete the outline for the two papers.
* Discussed potential future research opportunities.

**Action Items:**
* Exhaustive search of all available datasets with data on wearable sensors and ground truth data for stress detection.
